To make application work first download needed packages. Preferably in a virtual python environment. Then use 'streamlit run main.py' in the cmd if you are in the directory containing main.py. 

BETA VERSION AND STILL LOTS OF BUGS+PROBLEMS

Local vectorized chromadb databases. Working towards a network where computer resources are optionally shared for helping other embed their databases(chromadb in this case) also a community where you can download online chromadb vectorized databases to your local machine and choose between which AI model uses the database to retrieve answers. Currently trying DistelBERT for people with local computer's limited to 4GB RAM and higher. I want to use BM25 to filter which chunks of text correlate with input prompt most and distelBERT will form the response based on the prioritized chunks of text. I have a functioning local model which uses an Ollamh mistral model but ut does not have a FastAPI server hook for sending text to others devices for embedding.

There might be a cost involved. If people are not willing to run a local server and forward ports the servers will have to be cloud based. The servers will store peoples data redundantly at a cost ,but it will be a free point through which people can connect to each other using a API key or SSH key given to them through a verification emaial. It can also serve as a Educational platform where people from the same Educational intitutes can share material and vectorized databases of the material. The unique school email address can serve as a verification factor that one is part of an institute.

Currently an option for hosts who are not part of the cloud infrastructure can use a fastAPI application to provide server hooks which communicate through JSON format. Also a serach engine can be used to search for public databases through tags given to the datasets. It should be required that each data set contains text which can be monitored to see if it malicious/illegal information or not.
